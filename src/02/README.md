## Part 2. System research

**== Task ==**

Write a bash script. The script should output the following information:

**HOSTNAME** = _network name_  
**TIMEZONE** = _time zone as: **America/New_York UTC -5** (time zone must be taken from the system and be correct for the current location)_  
**USER** = _current user who ran the script_  
**OS** = _type and version of operating system_  
**DATE** = _current time as: **12 May 2020 12:24:36**_  
**UPTIME** = _system uptime_  
**UPTIME_SEC** = _system uptime in seconds_  
**IP** = _ip address of the machine on any of the network interfaces  
**MASK** = _network mask of any of the network interfaces as: **xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx**_.  
**GATEWAY** = _default gateway ip_  
**RAM_TOTAL** = _main memory size in GB with an accuracy of three decimal places as: **3.125 GB**_  
**RAM_USED** = _used memory size in GB with an accuracy of three decimal places_  
**RAM_FREE** = _free memory size in GB, with an accuracy of three decimal places_  
**SPACE_ROOT** = _root partition size in MB, with an accuracy of two decimal places, as **254.25 MB**_  
**SPACE_ROOT_USED** = _size of used space of the root partition in MB, with an accuracy of two decimal places_  
**SPACE_ROOT_FREE** = _size of free space of the root partition in MB, with an accuracy of two decimal places_

After outputting the values, suggest writing the data to a file (ask the user to answer **Y/N**).  
Responses **Y** and **y** are considered positive, all others - negative.

If the user agrees, create a file in the current directory containing the information that had been outputted.
The file name must looks like: **DD_MM_YY_HH_MM_SS.status** (The time in the file name must indicate when the data was saved).
